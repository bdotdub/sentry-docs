With Session Replay, Sentry users can get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session and getting additional information such as what would appear in the developer tools of a client browser.

To get instructions for how to set it up and start sending replays, click a link for one of the supported SDKs below.

## Supported SDKs

Session Replay supports all browser-based JavaScript applications. Itâ€™s built to work with `@sentry/browser` and our browser framework SDKs:

- [Vanilla JavaScript](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/)
- [Angular](/platforms/javascript/guides/angular/session-replay/)
- [Capacitor](/platforms/javascript/guides/capacitor/session-replay/)
- [Electron](/platforms/javascript/guides/electron/session-replay/)
- [Ember](/platforms/javascript/guides/ember/session-replay/)
- [Gatsby](/platforms/javascript/guides/gatsby/session-replay/)
- [Next.js](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/session-replay/)
- [React](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/session-replay/)
- [Remix](/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/session-replay/)
- [Svelte](/platforms/javascript/guides/svelte/session-replay/)
- [Vue](/platforms/javascript/guides/vue/session-replay/)

## Backend Error Linking

Backend error linking works via integrating replays with our tracing data model. When you have Sentry wired up on your frontend and backend, we have data connectivity end-to-end on your APIs and can link replays to backend endpoints.

With backend error linking, the **Replay Details** view includes backend errors in the Timeline, Breadcrumbs, Errors tab, and more. You'll also see a Replays tab and a preview of a replay in the **Issue Details** page for any backend error that has a linked replay.

For backend error linking to work, make sure you've set up trace propagation in your backend projects. For example:

```
Sentry.init({
  tracePropagationTargets: ["third-party-site.com", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],
});
```

Currently, backend error linking is supported for the following SDKs:

- Python [1.20.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/releases/tag/1.20.0)
- Node [7.48.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/7.48.0)
- PHP [3.18.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php/releases/tag/3.18.0)
- NET [3.31.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/releases/tag/3.31.0)
- Java [6.17.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/releases/tag/6.17.0)
- Ruby [5.9.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/releases/tag/5.9.0)
